		<p>Higher Education is more than what we learn in our course of academic study. The “University Experience” should certainly focus on academic excellence as a key pillar, but other endeavors help create what make us tomorrow’s leaders. In Student Services, we provide opportunities to stretch students to embrace diversity; provide multiple opportunities for engagement; aggressively educate students on how to make healthy choices, and create opportunities for them to serve their campus and local community.</p>
