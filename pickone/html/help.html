<h1>Picking One Thing: Getting Started</h1>
<p>Picking one thing is easy. In the menu to the right, you'll see a bunch of categories that contain activities and student organizations that can potentially be your "one." <strong>You can be as specific or as broad as you want with your one. </strong>You can choose a specific activity or just a category (Example: <a href="http://pickone.uiowa.edu/Category/Employment">Employment</a>)as your one.</p>
<p>In short: if you see this button:</p>
<p><img class="left" src="assets/guide-pickthisone.png" width="111" height="46" alt="" title=""/></p>
<p>--then the page you're on is Pickable.</p>
<h2>Picking One Thing That's Outside of This Website</h2>
<p>We've compiled an exhaustive list of student organizations and activites on this website, but sometimes an organization or activity's website is more informative and provides a clearer idea of what they're about. For example, these sites might have event calendars, blog posts, or image galleries that describe themselves in greater depth than our site. </p>
<p>Sometimes you'll find links to these websites while exploring the Pick One website. When you click on these links, you'll be taken to the organization or activity's website, but you'll see a blue bar at the top of your screen with a "pick this one" button.</p>
<p>After looking at the organization or activity's website, if you decide you want it as your pick, simply click "pick this one." If not, either close the website's tab, or click the pick one logo to return to the Pick One website to continue browsing.</p>
