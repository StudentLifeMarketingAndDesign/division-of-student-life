<h3>Work-Study Opportunities</h3>
<p>Work-Study is a need-based financial aid program. Students must apply through completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). If you were awarded Work-Study, JOBNET's search function also allows you to search for positions that are only being advertised as Work-Study. To do this, you must enter your Work-Study passcode. If you do not know your passcode, it is listed on your financial aid award letter available on ISIS.</p>
